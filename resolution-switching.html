    <blockquote>
        Resolution switching: The problem whereby you want to serve smaller image files to narrow screen devices, as they don't need huge images like desktop displays do â€” and also optionally that you want to serve different resolution images to high density/low density screens. This can be solved using vector graphics (SVG images), and the srcset and sizes attributes.

    <hr/>
    <ol>
        <li>Amount of entries in "srcset" and "sizes" have to be the same.</li>
        <li>Second param of "srcset" entry gives actual image size (width).</li>
        <li>Second param of "srcset" entry can match screen density.</li>
        <li>Second param of "sizes" can be in %, but only without media query. Otherwise, bad shit happens.</li>
        <li>Chromomium-based browsers do not fetch smaller image if bigger already fetched (in case of window narrowing).</li>
    </ol>
